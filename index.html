                        Hello! My name is Conall. <br> I am a first year student at DCU studying computer science who is deeply interested in science and technology. 
                        I chose this course because I love problem solving and computer science is an incredibly interesting field which satisfies both the problem-solving side of
                        my brain along with creative side of my brain as I think of new ways to apply my knowledge I have learned to make new and interesting things.
                        <br><br> My hobbies include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Baking</li>
                            <li>Maths</li>
                            <li>Drawing</li>
                            <li>Reading</li>
                            <li>Learning</li>
                            <li>Cycling</li>
                            <li>Playing Guitar</li>
                            <li>Traveling</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <!-- add your 200 word maximum work experience content here.  You can use lists of things as well as paragraphs.  Show off the HTML you know.  marks for the HTML, and how well you use it. marks deducted for poor grammar or spelling errors-->
                    <p>My work experience includes:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>From February to March of 2020 I worked as a reporter for theSunDaily newspaper in Malaysia.</li> <!-- note: theSunDaily is how the name was stylised -->
                        <li>From September to December 2019 I worked for IBC ltd and helped with transferring data as they were moving all their databases to SAP.
                            <br><br>IBC ltd are a Building Energy Management Systems company which provide equipment and systems necessary for making buildings more energy efficient.
                            This job was useful to me as I learned what databases are used for in the real world and how they work, and also gave me a greater interest in computer science
                            as I saw there were some very repetitive parts to my job (e.g copying and pasting many rows of data into a different sheet and ensuring it all adheres to a new format)
                            which could be easily automated if I just had enough programming knowledge which would have saved both the company and I a lot of time and effort spent copying data which could
                            have been better spent on other things.</li><br>
                        <li>From June - July 2018 I interned at theSunDaily as a reporter writing about crime and politics.</li>
